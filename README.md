# Cohort-Analysis
This repository explores cohort analysis, a powerful technique for analyzing user behavior in longitudinal studies. Here, I delve into the world of user segmentation and retention, leveraging Python to unlock actionable insights.

## Cohort Analysis 
Cohort analysis involves grouping users based on shared characteristics, typically their acquisition date. By tracking these cohorts over time, we could uncover trends in user behavior, retention patterns, and key metrics like churn and lifetime value (LTV).

## Benefits:
1. *Granular User Segmentation:* Isolate user behavior specific to distinct cohorts, enabling targeted product development and marketing initiatives.
2. *Retention Rate Revelation:* Identify cohorts exhibiting high churn rates, allowing for proactive interventions to boost user engagement.
3. *LTV Optimization:* Uncover cohorts with superior LTV, guiding resource allocation and customer success efforts.

Here I focused on **time-based cohorts**, where users are grouped by their acquisition date. However, the world of cohort construction is vast, and future explorations could involve:
* *Segment-based cohorts:* Grouping users based on product subscription tier, demographics, or other relevant segmentation criteria.
* *Size-based cohorts:* Segmenting users by factors like purchase history or company size.
